# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas

**By**: Marti Heit, Joleena Marshall, Faye Pei, and Nestor Teodoro Chavez.

## Our Goal 
The goal of this project is display how `Pandas`, a software library written for Python, is a great choice for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas will help you explore, clean, and process your data. In pandas, a data table is referred to as `DataFrame`. 

## The Description
This projects shows the entire process of EDA. Pandas handles data acquisition really well. Pandas is able to import   `xml`,`json`,`csv`,`xls`,and `html`.

## Getting Started 

Download the [eda-code.ipynb](https://github.com/neteodorochavez/msds610-eda-pandas/blob/main/EDA_code_demo.ipynb). Next, download the [data](https://github.com/neteodorochavez/msds610-eda-pandas/tree/main/data). If you'd like to use other datasets, make sure to add them into the data folder. The filetypes of choice have a wide range.

## Installation

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
```

## Our Process

### Benefits of Pandas Library

### Importing Data 

### Data Exploration
#### Manipulating Data Frame

### Preprocessing 

Preprocessing is the stage in EDA that explores the data and ensures its integrity. In other words, it makes sure that the data is properly formatting in order for the next step to begin. Oftentimes this stage deals with missing or misleading data, creating better features as a combination of information already provided by the dataset, and explores options for making the process of data retrieval more efficient.  

#### Converting Data Types
The benefit in using Pandas is that it allows one to easily convert data types. This stage is called data manipulation, and its where Pandas really shines. We are able to use functions that are specific to the pandas library to convert from one data type to another without altering the metadata itself. For instance, if a survey was recording birthdays of its users in order to find out, on average, how many users celebrate their birthday during the holiday months. Pandas allows to convert strings in the form of '12-24-2001' into a `datetime` object in order for us to easily extract month, day, or year. Common functionalities such as these are made efficient processes with the help from Pandas. 

#### Appending Data 
We've seen that data conversion is an important part in cleaning up data. 

#### Removing Data 
#### Indexing Data
