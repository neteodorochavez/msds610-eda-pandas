# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas

**By**: Marti Heit, Joleena Marshall, Faye Pei, and Nestor Teodoro Chavez

## Our Goal 
The goal of this project is display how Pandas, a software library written for Python, is a great choice for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas will help you explore, clean, and process your data. In pandas, a data table is referred to as `DataFrame`.
